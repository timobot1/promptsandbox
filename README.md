# Prompt Sandbox ðŸŽ¯

**Learn prompt engineering through practice, feedback, and iteration.**

Prompt Sandbox is an interactive learning tool that helps you master the art of prompt engineering. Write prompts, see results in real-time, get AI-powered feedback on what works (and what doesn't), and track your improvement over time.

## Why Prompt Sandbox?

### The Challenge
Prompt engineering is the first skill people need to learn in order to become AI-native and be able to use AI to get the results they want without having to guess everytime. Prompt engineering is the difference between a magical AI experience and a frustrating one where AI isn't working how you actually want it to. Without actually knowing what works or what needs to be improved in their prompt, people are left to guessing which slows down their learning.

In addition, most LLM interfaces we see today are chatbot interfaces. However, these chatbot interfaces are framed as a conversation that doesn't inform users how they need to structure their prompts. Users are used to chats being instant, quick and natural back and forth dialogue. However, prompting requires thought and intention in advance about what output is expected in order to craft proper instructions the AI can use to get there. There is nothing in these interfaces that guides users to think that way and improve in their ability to prompt llms. Thus, prompting remains mysterious and hard to understand, and users have no concrete way of improving. 

### The Gap in Current Tools
Most LLM interfaces are chatbot-style conversations that don't teach prompting...
